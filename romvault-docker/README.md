This project provides a Docker setup for running ROMVault, a popular ROM management tool. The Dockerfile contains all the necessary instructions to build an image that installs ROMVault and its dependencies.

## Project Structure

```

## Getting Started

To get started with the ROMVault Docker setup, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/romvault-docker.git
   cd romvault-docker
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t romvault .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   After building the image, you can run the container using:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name romvault-container -v /path/to/your/config:/config romvault
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/config` with the path where you want to store your ROMVault configuration.

## Usage

Once the container is running, you can access the ROMVault application. The application will be available at the specified port (if configured) on your host machine.
